## Wireless Questions

> The following 37 questions and their answers are collected from the _"CCNA Wireless 200-355"_ book.
> They form the questions listed in the beginning of the first 3 chapters of the book:
>
> 1. RF Signals and Modulation (First PDF)

1. Which one of the following is the common standard that defines wireless LAN
   operation?

   a. IEEE 802.1  
   b. IEEE 802.1x  
   c. IEEE 802.11  
   d. IEEE 802.3

   ```
   C. The IEEE 802.11 standard focuses on wireless LAN definitions, methods, and
   operation. It is made up of many pieces, as described in Chapter 2, “RF Standards.”
   Sometimes you might see IEEE 802.11x, which refers to the many subparts of
   802.11. Be aware of the subtle difference between that and 802.1x, which defines
   port-based network access control.
   ```

1. Which of the following represent the frequency bands commonly used for wireless
   LANs? (Choose two.)

   a. 2.4 MHz  
   b. 2.4 GHz  
   c. 5.5 MHz  
   d. 11 GHz  
   e. 5 GHz

   ```
   B, E. Wireless LANs use the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. Be careful to notice the
   difference between megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz). Also remember that 5.5
   Mbps and 11 Mbps are some of the common data rates used in wireless LANs, but
   those are not involved when you need to identify the frequency band.
   ```

1. Two transmitters are each operating with a transmit power level of 100 mW. When
   you compare the two absolute power levels, what is the difference in dB?

   a. 0 dB  
   b. 20 dB  
   c. 100 dB  
   d. You can’t compare power levels in dB.

   ```
   A. When the two power levels are the same, the result is 0 dB. As long as you remember
   the first handy Law of Zero, you will find exam questions like this easy. If not, you
   will need to remember that dB = 10log 10 (100 mW / 100 mW) = 10log 10 (1) = 0 dB.
   ```

1. A transmitter is configured to use a power level of 17 mW. One day it is reconfigured
   to transmit at a new power level of 34 mW. How much has the power level increased
   in dB?

   a. 0 dB  
   b. 2 dB  
   c. 3 dB  
   d. 17 dB  
   e. None of these answers are correct; you need a calculator to figure this out.

   ```
   C. At first glance, 17 mW and 34 mW might seem like odd numbers to work with.
   Notice that if you double 17, you get 34. The second handy dB fact says that
   doubling a power level will increase the dB value by 3.
   ```

1. Transmitter A has a power level of 1 mW, and transmitter B is 100 mW. Compare
   transmitter B to A using dB, and then identify the correct answer from the following
   choices.

   a. 0 dB  
   b. 1 dB  
   c. 10 dB  
   d. 20 dB  
   e. 100 dB

   ```
   D. Start with transmitter A’s level of 1 mW and try to figure out some simple opera-
   tions that can be used to get to transmitter B’s level of 100 mW. Remember the handy
   Laws of 3s and 10s, which use multiplication by 2 and 10. In this case, 1 mW × 10 =
   10 mW × 10 = 100 mW. Each multiplication by 10 adds 10 dB, so the end result is 10
   + 10 = 20 dB. Notice that transmitter B is being compared to A (the reference level),
   which is 1 mW. You could also state the end result in dB-milliwatt (dBm).
   ```

1. A transmitter normally uses an absolute power level of 100 mW. Through the course
   of needed changes, its power level is reduced to 40 mW. What is the power-level
   change in dB?

   a. 2.5 dB  
   b. 4 dB  
   c. –4 dB  
   d. –40 dB  
   e. None of these answers are correct; where is that calculator?

   ```
   C. This question involves a reduction in the power level, so the dB value must be
   negative. Try to find a simple way to start with 100 and get to 40 by multiplying or
   dividing by 2 or 10. In this case, 100 / 10 = 10; 10 × 2 = 20; 20 × 2 = 40. Dividing by
   10 reduced the dB value by 10 dB; then multiplying by 2 increased the total by +3
   dB; multiplying again by 2 increased the total by +3 more dB. In other words,
   dB = –10 + 3 + 3 = –4 dB.
   ```

1. Consider a scenario with a transmitter and a receiver that are separated by some
   distance. The transmitter uses an absolute power level of 20 dBm. A cable connects the
   transmitter to its antenna. The receiver also has a cable connecting it to its antenna.
   Each cable has a loss of 2 dB. The transmitting and receiving antennas each have a gain
   of 5 dBi. What is the resulting EIRP?

   a. +20 dBm  
   b. +23 dBm  
   c. +26 dBm  
   d. +34 dBm  
   e. None of these answers are correct.

   ```
   B. Remember that the EIRP involves radiated power, and that is calculated using
   only the transmitter components. The EIRP is the sum of the transmitter power
   level (+20 dBm), the cable loss (–2 dB), and the antenna gain (+5 dBi). Therefore,
   the EIRP is +23 dBm.
   ```

1. A receiver picks up an RF signal from a distant transmitter. Which one of the
   following represents the best signal quality received? Example values are given in
   parentheses.

   a. Low SNR (10 dB), Low RSSI (–75)  
   b. High SNR (30 dB), Low RSSI (–75)  
   c. Low SNR (10 dB), High RSSI (–30)  
   d. High SNR (30 dB), High RSSI (–30)

   ```
   D. A high SNR is best, where the received signal strength is more elevated above the
   noise floor. A 30-dBm SNR separates the signal from the noise more than a 10-dBm
   SNR does. Likewise, a higher RSSI value means that the signal strength alone is
   higher. The RSSI scale ranges from 0 (highest) to –100 (lowest).
   ```

1. The typical data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps can be supported by which one of the
   following modulation types?

   a. OFDM  
   b. FHSS  
   c. DSSS  
   d. QAM

   ```
   C. DSSS supports 1-, 2-, 5.5-, and 11-Mbps data rates through different combinations
   of coding and modulation schemes. FHSS is locked to 1 or 2 Mbps. With the
   exception of 6 and 9 Mbps, only OFDM supports the highest data rates of all the
   modulation types.
   ```

1. Put the following modulation schemes in order of the number of possible changes
   that can be made to the carrier signal, from lowest to highest.

   a. 16-QAM  
   b. DQPSK  
   c. DBPSK  
   d. 64-QAM

   ```
   C, B, A, D. The correct order is C, B, A, D or DBPSK (2 possible phase changes),
   DQPSK (4 possible phase changes), 16-QAM (16 possible phase/amplitude chang-
   es), 64-QAM (64 possible phase/amplitude changes).
   ```

1. 64-QAM modulation alters which two of the following aspects of an RF signal?

   a. Frequency  
   b. Amplitude  
   c. Phase  
   d. Quadrature

   ```
   B, C. Both 16-QAM and 64-QAM alter the amplitude and phase of a signal.
   ```

1. OFDM offers data rates up to 54 Mbps, but DSSS supports much lower limits.
   Compared with DSSS, which one of the following does OFDM leverage to achieve
   its superior data rates?

   a. Higher-frequency band  
   b. Wider 20-MHz channel width  
   c. 48 subcarriers in a channel  
   d. Faster chipping rates  
   e. Greater number of channels in a band

   ```
   C. OFDM uses 48 subcarriers in a single 20-MHz-wide channel, allowing it to
   transmit data bits in parallel. DSSS uses a single 22-MHz channel with only one
   main carrier signal.
   ```

   B. The U-NII-1 band is the first of four 5-GHz bands set aside for wireless LAN
   use.
   ```

   one of the following maximum values?

   a. 100 mW  
   b. 20 dBm  
   c. 50 mW  
   d. 36 dBm

   b. Use more radio chains  
   c. Switch to a more complex modulation scheme  
   d. Switch to a less-complex modulation scheme

   b. Multipath  
   c. Cross-channel fading  
   d. Free space path loss

   the signal takes a different path to reach the receiver; thus, the name multipath.
   ```

1. Which one of the following best describes the effect that a building material has as an RF signal passes through a wall?

   a. Reflection  
   b. Refraction  
   c. Diffraction

   d. The area around a transmitter that represents the range of a signal

   ```
   B. The first Fresnel zone is an elliptical area along the length of a signal path that
   should be kept free of obstructions. When an object extends into a significant portion of the Fresnel zone,
   the signal can be diffracted and distorted.
